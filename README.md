# Data-Lake-Architecture-using-Apache-Iceberg-Snowflake-and-AWS

I had the opportunity to dive deep into the intricacies of modernizing Data Lakes with Apache Iceberg, leveraging AWS Glue and Snowflake to enhance data management and analytics capabilities. Here are some key insights and takeaways from this enriching experience:<br>

**‚ú® Integration Mastery:**
I explored how Snowflake seamlessly integrates with Amazon S3 and the AWS Glue Data Catalog. This integration simplifies data ingestion and lays a robust foundation for scalable and efficient data lake architectures. The ease of setting up this integration demonstrated how powerful these tools can be when combined, enabling us to focus more on data analysis rather than data management logistics.<br>

**üîÑ Data Transformation Excellence:** One of the highlights was mastering the conversion of Parquet files to Iceberg tables using AWS Glue. This wasn't just a straightforward format conversion. I configured the Glue ETL jobs to transform raw Parquet data into Iceberg format, optimizing data storage and query performance. This process involved creating Glue databases and tables, and setting up ETL jobs that efficiently transformed and loaded data into Iceberg tables.<br>

**üîç Advanced Analytics:** Using Snowflake, I performed detailed analytics by combining Iceberg table data with internal Snowflake datasets. For instance, I queried the Quotes Iceberg table alongside internal Customer and Policy tables to derive comprehensive insights into customer behavior and policy trends. This combination allowed me to identify patterns such as which customers with more than five quotes had renewed policies and their premium details, driving informed decision-making.<br>

**üìÑ Table Creation Expertise:** I deep-dived into creating Snowflake Iceberg tables using both External Catalogs (Glue Data Catalog) and the native Snowflake Catalog. This dual approach ensured robust data governance and security while enhancing data accessibility. Creating these tables involved specifying schema details, configuring S3 data locations, and ensuring that the data was stored efficiently for optimal query performance.<br>

**üìä Aggregate Data Management:** One of the key tasks was creating an aggregate dataset by combining Quotes data in Iceberg with Customer and Policy data in internal Snowflake tables. This involved writing the aggregated data back to S3 in Iceberg format, enabling different services and engines to consume the data. This step showcased the flexibility and power of Snowflake in handling complex data workflows and facilitating seamless data sharing across platforms.<br>

**üîß Real-world Application:** This hands-on lab was more than just technical proficiency; it was a journey into harnessing data's transformative power. The skills and insights gained are directly applicable to real-world scenarios, where efficient data transformation and integration can drive business growth and innovation.<br>
